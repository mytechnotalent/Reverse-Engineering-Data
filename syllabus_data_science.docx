- Familiarity with the command line
- High school-level mathematics/statistics

Required Skills and Hardware/Software
- Python programming (variables, loops, functions, modules)
- Jupyter notebooks (installation provided)
- Git and GitHub basics
- Laptop capable of running Jupyter notebooks (Anaconda or pip)
- Ability to install libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels

Tools Used
- JupyterLab/Notebook
- Python 3.8+
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code or any text editor
- mytechnotalent/Reverse-Engineering-Data notebooks
